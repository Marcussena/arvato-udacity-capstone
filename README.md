# Create a Customer Segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Services
## 1. Introduction
The prime goal of this project is to analyze datasets to perform a data segmentation and provide valuable insights about how customers relate to general population and design a machine learning model to predict the probability of each individual in a dataset to become a new customer.
The workflow was divided in the following sections:
- Part 0: Get to Know the Data
- Part 1: Customer Segmentation Report
- Part 2: Supervised Learning Model
- Part 3: Kaggle Competition

Finally, the results of the model were uploaded on a Kaggle competition in order to evaluate how good the model performed relative to others.
In addition, I've written a blogpost on medium with more detail and explanations available in https://marcusmvls-vinicius.medium.com/customer-segmentation-of-demographic-database-for-arvato-financial-solutions-ad9d2d96acd8
